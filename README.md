# End-to-End-Retail-Ecosystem-Simulation-AI-Accelerated-
Designed an AI-accelerated simulation engine for a major Australian retailer, generating 1M+ relational rows. Acting as System Architect, I optimized Python scripts with Gemini Pro and NumPy, achieving a 94% performance boost (2 hours to 7 mins). Features validated business logic, seasonality trends, and 100% relational integrity.
